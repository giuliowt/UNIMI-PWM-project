# UNIMI WEB PROGRAMMING PROJECT

This is my project made for the coure of web programming at UNIMI (Universit√† degli studi di Milano)
It includes Front-end + back-End and utilizes mongoDB and JSON files to properly store the data

<h3>How to Run Server</h3>

- Use nodeJS to start the server with 'node ./index.js' in Server directory
- Ensure the mongoDB server is still active, otherwise create a new DB and change the URI in index.js 
- If using extension to run the website in localhost (e.g. liveserver, webserver) ensure hosting only the directory 'codice' in order to avoid bugs
